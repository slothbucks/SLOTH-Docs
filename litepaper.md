# SlothBucks ($SLOTH) Litepaper

## Abstract

$SLOTH token embodies the steady determination of the sloth, favoring consistency over speed. Our mission leverages the systematic potency of arbitrage, Maximum Extractable Value (MEV), and sniper strategies to aim for a daily compounded interest rate of 3%. This rate, compounded daily, has the potential to transform a modest initial investment into over $25 million within the span of a year. The crux of this challenge lies in the consistent application, a path often thwarted by significant losses. $SLOTH intervenes by distributing a series of micro moonshot bets, entirely financed by risk-free arbitrage and MEV opportunities, thus eliminating the possibility of failure while not guaranteeing success.

## Introduction

In a financial ecosystem that rewards the swift, the power of persistence and steadiness is often overlooked. $SLOTH brings a paradigm shift, embodying a long-term strategy that is designed to outlive the fluctuations and uncertainties inherent in the market.

## Strategy

$SLOTH's foundational strategy is to place a multitude of small, strategic moonshot bets. This approach minimizes the impact of losses while maintaining an open window for substantial gains, with funding sourced exclusively from arbitrage and MEV opportunities—thereby negating the traditional risks associated with seeking high returns.

### Arbitrage and MEV

Arbitrage exploits price differences across exchanges, while MEV finds opportunities within the Ethereum blockchain, such as transaction order manipulation. $SLOTH's algorithms are finely tuned to identify and capitalize on these opportunities, fueling the strategy's moonshot bets.

### Compounding Interest

The objective is to achieve a daily compounded interest of 3%. Despite the inherent challenges in such an endeavor, $SLOTH is engineered to automate this process, continuously seeking and reinvesting gains with unwavering discipline.

## Risk Mitigation

$SLOTH redefines the correlation between high returns and high risks by decoupling user funds from high-risk bets. The strategy operates solely with the yield from arbitrage and MEV, ensuring that while success is not assured, failure is systematically eradicated from the equation.

## Conclusion

$SLOTH represents a novel financial instrument for the investor who values the might of compound interest. By automating a risk-averse strategy that capitalizes on blockchain's native opportunities, $SLOTH aims to prove that with the right technology and methodology, slow and steady doesn't just win the race—it revolutionizes it.
